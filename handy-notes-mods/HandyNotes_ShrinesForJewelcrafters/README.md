# Credits

First of all, this addon is essentailly written by Imoom, whose plugin I believe is also based on Kemayo's works. Therefore, I'd like to credit both of them for essentially having done almost all the major work, whereas mine is only about adding and changing a few lines.

# Description

This is just another plugin for the HandyNotes addon with all locations of six shrines where Jewelcrafters can create major gems, daily.

# Options

All options can be found under in HandyNotes Interface options. To open settigs:
* go to __Interface__ followed by __AddOns__, HandyNotes, and __Plugins__, or
* type `/handynotes` in a console

All settings are saved per individually character. There is also an option to hide notes if a character is not a jewelcrafter.
