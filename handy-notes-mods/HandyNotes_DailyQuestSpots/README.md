#### **Credits**
Credits and massive thanks to Imoom, Kemayo and HandyNotes authors.

#### **Description**
This is an addon in progress. The idea is to show location of quest objects. Currently the addon shows only two kind of quest objects: Coral Ancients in Nazjatar and treasures in Mechagon.

#### **Options**
All the options can be found in the **Interface** under the **HandyNotes** options. To open settings:

* go to `Interface` followed by `AddOns`, followed by `HandyNotes`, and `Plugins`, or
* type `/handynotes` in a console

All settings are saved individually per character.
